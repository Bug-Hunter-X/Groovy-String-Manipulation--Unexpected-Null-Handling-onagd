# Groovy String Manipulation Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy code related to null handling during string manipulation. The `myMethod` function is designed to handle null input by returning an empty string. However, when a non-null string is passed, an unexpected error occurs, highlighting a potential issue with the method's logic.

## Bug Description
The primary bug lies in the assumption of string immutability in Groovy when it comes to null checking. The conditional check `if (str == null)` correctly handles null inputs, but the subsequent operations on the string may not be properly prepared for scenarios where `str` could be null or empty, leading to unexpected results. 

## Solution
The improved `myMethod` in `FixedGroovyCode.groovy` adds a check for empty strings, providing a more comprehensive approach to handling different input conditions.  This ensures that the method behaves correctly for null, empty, and non-empty strings.
